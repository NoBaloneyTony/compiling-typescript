## Notes
###  Q Where does the JS file that is served come from? Is build done automatically?
### A npm run build is automatically run when the web server button is clicked

### Why does send not work? Because its http not express

### why is "install new packages" grayed out?
That's a real mystery. Use npm install instead maybe.
